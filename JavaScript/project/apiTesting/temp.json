With the release of the survey results only 10 days after the completion of data collection, the LFS estimates are the first of the major monthly economic data series to be released. The Canadian Labour Force Survey was developed following the Second World War to satisfy a need for reliable and timely data on the labour market. Information was urgently required on the massive labour market changes involved in the transition from a war to a peace-time economy. The main objective of the LFS is to divide the working-age population into three mutually exclusive classifications - employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force - and to provide descriptive and explanatory data on each of these. LFS data are used to produce the well-known unemployment rate as well as other standard labour market indicators such as the employment rate and the participation rate. The LFS also provides employment estimates by industry, occupation, public and private sector, hours worked and much more, all cross-classifiable by a variety of demographic characteristics. Estimates are produced for Canada, the provinces, the territories and a large number of sub-provincial regions. For employees, wage rates, union status, job permanency and workplace size are also produced. These data are used by different levels of government for evaluation and planning of employment programs in Canada. Regional unemployment rates are used by Employment and Social Development Canada to determine eligibility, level and duration of insurance benefits for persons living within a particular employment insurance region. The data are also used by labour market analysts, economists, consultants, planners, forecasters and academics in both the private and public sector.",

The total number of records for each variable is comprised of both the sysmiss and valid values. LFS revisions: LFS estimates were previously based on the 2001 Census population estimates. These data have been adjusted to reflect 2006 Census population estimates and were revised back to 1996. The census metropolitan area (CMA) variable has been expanded from the three largest CMAs in Canada to nine. Two occupation variables based on the 2016 National Occupation Classicifcation have been reintroduced: a generic 10- category variable (NOC_10) and a detailed 40-category variable (NOC_40). A new variable on immigrant status (IMMIG) has been introduced, which distingushes between recent immigrants and established immigrants.

This was not the case in earlier releases in which above $150k loans held business name, address, and an amount range, while the below $150k loans held exact amounts but no name or address. This deprecates the need for our computed loan minimum, average, and maximum fields, which now all contain the same loan amount.</p><strong>U.S. Counties</strong><p>This data product has added the <strong>inferred primary</strong> U.S. County Code to each record based on the zip codes in the original data file. These may be inaccurate for recipients in ZIP codes spanning multiple counties.</p> <strong>NAICS</strong> <p>The codes used to identify a business industry are expected to be based on the 2017 version of the <a href='https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/index.html' target='_blank'>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)</a>. Be aware that unfortunately many entries seem to be using codes from previous versions, going all the way back to 1997 edition, in which case we are not able to provide an accurate value label. We are investigating options to correct for this.</p><strong>PPP Is A Delegated Loan Making Process</strong><p>PPP loans are not made by SBA. PPP loans are made by lending institutions and then guaranteed by SBA. Accordingly, borrowers apply to lenders and self-certify that they are eligible for PPP loans. The self-certification includes a good faith certification that the borrower has economic need requiring the loan and a certification that the borrower has applied the affiliation rules and is a small business, among other certifications The lender then reviews the borrower’s application, and if all the paperwork is in order, approves the loan and submits it to SBA.</p><strong>PPP Loan Data Is Not Indicative of Loan Forgiveness or Program Compliance</strong><p>A small business or non-profit organization that is listed in the publicly released data has been approved for a PPP loan by a delegated lender. However, the lender’s approval does not reflect a determination by SBA that the borrower is eligible for a PPP loan or entitled to loan forgiveness. All PPP loans are subject to SBA review and all loans over $2 million will automatically be reviewed. The fact that a borrower is listed in the data as having a PPP loan does not mean that SBA has determined that the borrower complied with program rules or is eligible to receive a PPP loan and loan forgiveness. Further, a small business’s receipt of a PPP loan should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the small business’ business activity or business model.</p><strong>Canceled Loans Do Not Appear In The PPP Loan Data</strong><p>The public PPP data includes only active loans. Loans that were canceled for any reason are not included in the public data release.</p><strong>PPP Loan Demographic Data Is Voluntarily Submitted</strong><p>PPP loan data reflects the information borrowers provided to their lenders in applying for PPP loans. SBA can make no representations about the accuracy or completeness of any information that borrowers provided to their lenders. Not all borrowers provided all information. For example, approximately 75% of all PPP loans did not include any demographic information because that information was not provided by the borrowers. SBA is working to collect more demographic information from borrowers to better understand which small businesses are benefiting from PPP loans. The loan forgiveness application expressly requests demographic information for borrowers.</p>",

This data is provisional and subject to change. This data may be different than information reported by a school, district, or other entity due to timing of reporting or other factors. In addition, this data may be different than county-level information reported by the Tennessee Department of Health due to timing of reporting, the fact that positive cases are reported by TDH only after laboratory confirmation, or other factors. School districts and public charter schools are requested to report positive COVID-19 cases to TDOE but are not mandated to do so by law or regulation. COVID-19 case investigations are conducted by local health departments.</p><p>To protect individual privacy, schools with fewer than 50 students are not reported in this data. Further, for schools reporting a number that is fewer than five positive student or employee COVID-19 cases, the school will be listed without a specific number of cases for the category. Decisions regarding reporting this data balance transparency, public health and individual privacy and may change as circumstances change.</p><p>New cases represent the number of newly reported positive cases on the most recent reporting date.
